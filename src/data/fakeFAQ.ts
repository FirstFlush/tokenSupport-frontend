      title: 'What is decentralized fundraising?',
      content: `Decentralized fundraising is a new model of raising funds that leverages decentralized finance (De-Fi) on blockchain networks. 
      Unlike traditional fundraising, which often relies on banks or third-party platforms, decentralized fundraising allows transactions to happen directly between the fundraiser and the donors, without intermediaries. 
      The use of smart contracts (self-executing contracts) ensures that the terms of the fundraising are transparent and automatically enforced, providing more efficiency and reducing the risk of fraud.`

      title: 'Why decentralized?',
      content: `Decentralization offers several benefits, including censorship resistance, tamper resistance, and security.

      - **Censorship resistance**: Traditional fundraising platforms can be subject to restrictions, regulation, or censorship. Decentralized fundraising on blockchain operates globally, without the need for permission from a central authority. This means funds can be raised and transferred without fear of being blocked by any government or institution.

      - **Tamper resistance**: Data stored on the blockchain cannot be easily altered or tampered with. Every transaction is recorded in a public ledger that is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once it's added. This ensures transparency and trust between the fundraiser and the donors.

      - **Security**: Blockchain is inherently secure because it uses cryptography to protect data. Decentralized systems distribute data across many nodes, making it very difficult for hackers to compromise the system compared to a centralized platform.`

      title: 'Can I trust decentralized fundraising?',
      content: `Yes, decentralized fundraising is built on blockchain technology, which provides a high level of trust and security. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts.

      **Smart contracts**: These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute actions (like releasing funds) when specific conditions are met, without the need for an intermediary.

      **Immutability**: Once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or tampered with. This immutability ensures that the rules of the fundraising campaign are transparent and cannot be changed after the fact.

      **Open-source code**: Smart contracts used for decentralized fundraising are typically open-source, meaning anyone can review the code to ensure it behaves as expected. This openness provides additional trust for users who may be wary of fraudulent platforms.`

      title: "Doesn't Ethereum's gas fees make this expensive?",
      content: `While Ethereum's main network (Layer 1) can have high gas fees due to network congestion, this problem is addressed with **Polygon**, a Layer 2 scaling solution.

      - **Polygon Layer 2**: Polygon works on top of Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions while still benefiting from Ethereum's security. By processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain, Polygon can significantly reduce gas fees, making decentralized fundraising more cost-effective and accessible to everyone.

      - **Cost savings**: By using Polygon, you can raise and transfer funds without worrying about the high costs associated with Ethereum's network, all while maintaining the security and decentralization benefits of Ethereum.`
